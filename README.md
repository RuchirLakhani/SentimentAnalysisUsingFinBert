**Sentiment Analysis Using FinBert**
This Python script performs sentiment analysis on financial articles using the FinBert model. It classifies the sentiment of each article into one of three categories: positive, negative, or neutral. This can be valuable for analyzing a large number of financial articles and gaining insights into the sentiment surrounding a particular stock or financial instrument.

**Requirements**
To run this script, you need the following:
  Python 3.x
  PyTorch
  Transformers library
  Pandas
  NumPy
  Installation
  Clone the repository or download the script file.

Install the required packages by running the following command:
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy
Download the FinBert pre-trained model weights. You can find the model on the official Hugging Face model repository or other reliable sources. Place the model files in the same directory as the script.

**Usage**
Prepare your financial articles in a CSV file. The file should have a column containing the text of each article.
Run the script with the following command:

python sentiment_analysis.py --input_file articles.csv
Replace articles.csv with the path to your CSV file.

The script will process each article and output the sentiment classification (0 for positive, 1 for negative, and 2 for neutral) for each article.

**Customization**
If you have a different pre-trained FinBert model, you can replace the provided model files with your own.
You can modify the script to suit your specific requirements, such as handling different input file formats or performing additional preprocessing.

**Credits**
The FinBert model is based on the BERT model developed by Google. For more information, refer to the original BERT repository.
This script utilizes the Transformers library by Hugging Face. You can find more information about the library here.

The script was developed by [Ruchir Lakhani] as part of [Financial Articles Sentiments Analysis] or for personal use. Feel free to modify and use it according to your needs.

**Disclaimer**
The sentiment analysis provided by this script is based on machine learning models and may not always accurately reflect the sentiment expressed in financial articles. It is recommended to use the results as a starting point for further analysis and not solely rely on them for making financial decisions.
The script and the provided FinBert model are provided as-is, without any warranties or guarantees. Use them at your own risk.
Feel free to customize the README based on your specific requirements and the details of your project.
